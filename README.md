## 3205 Task (Frontend)

In this project, I used Vue 3 to create a simple frontend for the 3205 Task. For styling, I mainly used 
Tailwind CSS. You can view the project on netlify: https://3205-frontend.netlify.app/

There's also a backend for this project, which is a simple REST API created using Express.js. You can view the 
backend project on GitHub: https://github.com/Abulkosim/3205-backend
